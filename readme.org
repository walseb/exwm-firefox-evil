* exwm-firefox-evil - Evil-mode keys in firefox
exwm-firefox-evil makes firefox's control scheme modal. It uses vi-like keys and doesn't require any addons. It does this by implementing [[https://github.com/walseb/exwm-firefox-core][exwm-firefox-core]] which sends fake keys to firefox using exwm.

To get link-hints you have to download a link-hint addon to firefox and define a new function to send that key to firefox on call like those in =exwm-firefox-core=.

** Install
